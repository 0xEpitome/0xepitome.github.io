Hello there, recently I have been learning pwn or binary exploitation especially for CTFS. This is me writing a blog of the writeups of some of the challenges I tackled. It will also include some CTF writeups that I have managed to do thus far. More like notes kind of thing. Tools to be used Pwntools, gdb(I prefer gdb-gef), ghidra.

PS: I am beginner in this field, so if you see any mistake or any 
misexplanation feel free to correct me. Thanks!
